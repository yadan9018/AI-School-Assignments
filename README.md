# AI-School-Assignments
Welcome to my AI School Assignments repository! ðŸŽ“ðŸ¤–  This repository serves as a collection of my assignments and projects from my coursework in artificial intelligence. Here, you will find various implementations, algorithms, and experiments that explore the fundamentals of AI and machine learning.  




## What to Expect:
1. Assignments: Each assignment is organized into its own folder, containing the necessary code, documentation, and results.
2. Project Descriptions: Clear explanations of the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes of each assignment to help you understand my approach and findings.
3. Technologies Used: You'll find a variety of technologies and programming languages, including Python, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, among others.
4. Future Improvements: I plan to continuously update this repository as I progress in my studies, adding new projects and refining existing ones.
   
Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or collaborate on any of the projects! Your input is greatly appreciated.

Letâ€™s dive into the world of AI together! ðŸŒŸ
